# Swarm-Trajectories

This repository hosts the demo source code for the paper "Fast generation of collision-free trajectories for robot swarms using GPU acceleration", which is due to be published as open access in the IEEE Access Journal. An early-access version can be found: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8587164

A very high-level overview of the demos presented here can be found at: http://mikehamer.info/swarm-trajectories/
Further information to the approach will be released once the paper has been accepted.

Tested using:
- Python 3
- PyTorch version 0.4.1
- CUDA version 9.2.148
- cuDNN version 7.1.4

To run the demos, simply run (using python) the two CaseStudy programs.
